### Enable File Storage Security

Follow the steps below to deploy the stack on your AWS account.

1. In the **File Storage Security** console:
    - Select **Stack Management**
    - Select **Deploy**

![Deploy All In One](/images/3.malware-scanning-solution/002-deploy-all-in-one.png)

2. To deploy an all-in-one stack, select **Scanner Stack and Storage Stack**

3. On the **Deploy Scanner Stack and Storage Stack** dialog box:
    - For **Step 1**, make sure you are signed in to your AWS account
    - For **Step 2**, select the AWS region where you want to deploy the all-in-one stack. The region must match the region of the S3 buckets you created
    - Select **Review Stack** to view the contents of the stack template before deploying it
    - Select **Launch Stack**

You will be redirected to the AWS Quick create stack page of **AWS CloudFormation**

4. Fill in the information in **Quick create stack** as follows
- **Stack name**: Specify the name of the stack. For example: `All-in-one-TM-FileStorageSecurity`
- **S3BucketToScan**: Specify the name of the S3 bucket we intend to scan. Here I have created: `aws-fcj-staging-bucket`
- Leave the remaining fields as they are, or you can refer to some more options [here](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/docs/file-storage-security/gs-deploy-all-in-one-stack/)
- At the bottom of the page, select all the **I acknowledge** [...] check boxes.
- Select **Create Stack**

5. Wait for the Stack to be created. This may take a few minutes. You'll know when everything is installed when you see three **CREATE_COMPLETE** messages for the **File Storage Security** stack.

You have completed creating the all-in-one stack. Continue the steps below to complete the ARNs configuration.

### Configure ARNs â€“ File Storage Security

After deploying the all-in-one stack, we need to configure the scanner and storage stack [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html). The ARN maps the scanner stack to the storage stack, allowing them to recognize each other.

1. Go to **CloudFormation** -> **Stack** -> select the all-in-one stack we created in the step above -> select **Outputs** tab

2. Copy and paste **ScannerStackManagementRoleARN** and **StorageStackManagementRoleARN** into the **File Storage Security** console screen

![Config ARNs](/images/3.malware-scanning-solution/009-configure-arn.png)

3. Select **Submit**
   - When successful, a success message is displayed and the result screen is as follows

So you have finished configuring ARNs.
