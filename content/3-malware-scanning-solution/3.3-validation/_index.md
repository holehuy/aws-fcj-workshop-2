### Overal

To test our malware detection solution, we need to create a malicious file to upload to the **Staging Bucket**.

We will use **eicar file** - a file designed to test and determine the performance of anti-virus software without causing any real threat to the system. This file contains a specific string of characters that antivirus software recognizes as a fake virus.

Here are some important points about EICAR files:

- Purpose: Used to test the performance and sensitivity of anti-virus software.
- Content: EICAR files have simple content, usually just a string of characters, but are recognized by antivirus software as a threat.
- Safe: This file is completely safe and is not capable of causing harm to the system.


### Content

1. To create an **eicar file**:
- Temporarily disable your virus scanner on your computer. If not, it will detect the eicar file and delete it.
- Create a file named **sample-malware.txt** and paste the content below
`X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`

2. Upload **eicar file** to **Staging Bucket**:
- Access AWS console -> search and select **S3** -> select **Staging Bucket** you created in previous steps. `aws-fcj-staging-bucket`
- Select Upload and download the file **sample-malware.txt** -> **File Storage Security** will scan the file and detect malicious code.

3. Check **Production Bucket** and **Quarantine Bucket** to see if malware files have moved to **Quarantine Bucket**

4. Check the object in **Staging Bucket** to see scan result tags

5. You can also monitor scanning activity in Trend Micro Cloud Console
